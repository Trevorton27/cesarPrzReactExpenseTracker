# Summary 

This Expense Tracker was my first app using React and I really learned a lot building this application. Learning the basics of React really laid out the groundwork to create  
bigger and more complex projects. Mainly learning how React components interact with each other and how State is such an important aspect of React. To understand State makes 
a dynamic website more fluid also makes reading the code much more manageable in turn, easier to maintain. Making this app was a fun challenge and it caused me to think differently about how an application works.
